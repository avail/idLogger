## idLogger

A project that attempts to add support for non-nVidia GPUs to Initial D 6 Arcade Stage


## How to run

Download the latest binary from the [releases](https://github.com/avail/idLogger/releases) page

Put it where id6_dump_.exe is located (main game folder) and run it as usual.

If the game crashes, create a new [issue](https://github.com/avail/idLogger/issues) on GitHub, with idLogger-game.txt from the plugins/ directory attached to the issue, and provide info on what GPU you've got.
